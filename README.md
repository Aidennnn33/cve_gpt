# cve_gpt Introduction
The API service provided by wgpsec/urlscan is a code that shows basic IPs, domains, and title information based on information from  [urlscan.io](http://urlscan.io/)'s API and Baidu, China's largest search engine. Based on this concept, I created **cve_gpt**, a code based on an OSINT search engine, Criminal IP's API that finds and shows IP and domain information, cve_id, and descriptions when there is a vulnerability in the connected IP address just by entering a keyword or domain.
